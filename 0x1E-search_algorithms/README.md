## Description
This project implements various search algorithms in C programming language including Linear Search, Binary Search, Jump Search, Exponential Search, Interpolation Search, and Advanced Binary Search. It also explores the implementation of search algorithms in data structures like singly linked list and skip list. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of search algorithms, their time and space complexities, and their practical implementations.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, learners are expected to:

- Understand the concept of search algorithms.
- Implement linear and binary search algorithms.
- Analyze the time and space complexities of search algorithms.
- Implement advanced search algorithms such as jump search, exponential search, and interpolation search.
- Apply search algorithms in various data structures like arrays, singly linked lists, and skip lists.
